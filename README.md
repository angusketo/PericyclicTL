# PericyclicTL
Data generation notebooks for pericyclic datasets. For Dielsâ€“Alder reaction, see https://github.com/angusketo/DA_DataExtraction

Extracting these datasets requires a Reaxys subscription. Once the reactions have been downloaded to a .csv format, the notebooks can be used.

RDKit Version: 2021.03.2
  Later versions of RDKit should work but the SMILES canonicalization method changed in an update. A different RDKit SMILES canonicalization method might cause issues.

Atom mapping can be done via RXNMapper: https://github.com/rxn4chemistry/rxnmapper (Access date: 10 December 2021)
